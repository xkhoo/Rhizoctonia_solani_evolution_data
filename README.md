This repository is for the attachment of complex tables for Xin Zhi Khoo's M.S. thesis: A GLOBAL META-ANALYSIS OF THE HOST RANGE, DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION OF _RHIZOCTONIA SOLANI_. 

There are 3 chapters covered in the thesis. Therefore, three chapters are created in this repository.

The table label for each supplementary table is included in the thesis and listed below.


CHAPTER 1:

Table 1.1: Metadata of 3,648 _Rhizoctonia solani_ isolates obtained from Genbank and used in this study. 


CHAPTER 2:

Table 2.1: Metadata of the complete ITS dataset containing 4,119 _Rhizoctonia solani_ isolates collected in the last 70 years and newly sequenced isolates from Nebraska.

Table 2.2: Metadata of the concatenated dataset containing 49 _Rhizoctonia solani_ isolates.



CHAPTER 3:

Table 3.2: Metadata of 914 _Rhizoctonia solani_ AG-3 isolates included in the global alignment.

Table 3.2: Sequence difference matrix of 37 _Rhizoctonia solani_ isolates obtained from Fungal Ecology Lab Culture Collection (FELCC). 

Table 3.3: Sequence difference matrix of 50 representative isolates based on the global alignment of _Rhizoctonia solani_ AG-3 subpopulations, which are collected from different hosts.
